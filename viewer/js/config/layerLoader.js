Information on air releases is contained in the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS), a computer-based repository for information about air pollution in the United States. This information comes from source reports by various stationary sources of air pollution, such as electric power plants, steel mills, factories, and universities, and provides information about the air pollutants they produce. In AIRS, these sources are known as facilities, and the part of AIRS associated with data about sources is called the AIRS Facility Subsystem, or AFS. The information in AFS is used by the states to prepare State Implementation Plans, to track the compliance status of point sources with various regulatory programs, and to report air emissions estimates for pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. Envirofacts air release information specifically relates to industrial plants and their components (stacks, points, and segments). This data provides valuable information not only about the industrial facilities, but about the chemicals they introduce into your local air. There is information available on managing operating permit application and renewals. You may use the Air Releases Query to retrieve selected data from the Envirofacts Database employing any combination of facility name, geographic location, and standard industrial classification.

The file lists the last reporting year the Facility submitted an active and valid data to the TRI program. TRI tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment. U.S. facilities in different industry sectors must report annually how much of each chemical is released to the environment and/or managed through recycling, energy recovery and treatment. (A \"release\" of a chemical means that it is emitted to the air or water, or placed in some type of land disposal.) The information submitted by facilities is compiled in the Toxics Release Inventory. TRI helps support informed decision-making by industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the public.",

Dredged material is sediment excavated or otherwise removed from the bottoms of the navigable waters of the United States to maintain navigation channels and docks. In October 1972, Congress enacted the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), sometimes referred to as the Ocean Dumping Act, declaring that it is the policy of the United States to regulate the dumping of all materials which would adversely affect human health, welfare or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems or economic potentialities. EPA is responsible for designating and managing ocean dumping sites under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA).

Unlike the Resource Priorities models, the Aggregated CLIP model does take into account overlap across resource types to promote some areas to Priorities 1 and 2. Wherever a location meets criteria for more than one priority class, the highest priority is assigned. Although all priority levels have significance, based on expert consensus the most important priorities are CLIP Priorities 1 and 2. CLIP Priority 3 can be considered moderate priority at the statewide scale. CLIP Priority 4 includes areas that still have resource significance but are the lower ranked areas for many of the CLIP core data layers.

    "description": "This dataset contains the spatial extent of AM tower structures in the state of Florida. AM stands for \"Amplitude Modulation\", which refers to the means of encoding the audio signal on the carrier frequency. In many countries, AM radio stations are known as \"medium wave\"(MW) stations. AM stations are also sometimes referred to as \"standard broadcast stations\", since AM was the first form used to transmit broadcast radio signals to the public. AM towers are unique in that AM stations have different operations for daytime and nighttime operation. This is because AM signals go further at night, due to atmospheric changes. Usually day and night operations are at the same site, but some may use different sites. These daytime and nighttime operations lead to duplicate records at the same location. Because we are only interested in tower locations and not individual AM stations for this particular dataset duplicate records representing day/night stations were removed.",

They are typically grey in color (color can range from black to light brown) and occasionally spotted with barnacles or colored by patches of green or red algae. The muzzle is heavily whiskered and coarse, single hairs are sparsely distributed throughout the body. Adult manatees, on average, are about nine feet long (3 meters) and weigh about 1,000 pounds (200 kilograms).

This data set includes both government managed facilities accessible to the general public and commerciality operated facilities accessible to the general public. In both cases a fee might be charged for use of the facility. The attribute fields included in this data set are a subset of those available in the raw data set. These attribute fields were selected and modified to present only attribute information that might be of most interest to the general public desiring to use these facilities.

Aids to navigation include light buoys and beacons. This data set includes federal aids, which are installed and maintained by the Coast Guard, as well as some privately maintained aids. This data set does not include unofficial (illegal) aids, such as PVC pipes, placed without permission. This data set is not certified for navigation and is not intended for navigation purposes. Each USCG district headquarters is responsible for updating its database on an as-needed basis. When existing aids are destroyed or relocated and new aids are installed, the database is updated. Each aid is assigned an official light listing number. The Light List is a document listing the status of the ATONs; it is regularly published and distributed. Interim changes to the Light List are published in local notices to mariners. In addition, the USCG broadcasts notices to mariners on the marine band radio as soon as changes in the status of individual aids are reported. Navigators should use the official notices to mariners to maintain current charts. Annual (or more frequent) updates of the Aids to Navigation database can be obtained from each USCG district headquarters. ",

This data set comprises a portion of the ESI data for Florida. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. See also the ESIP and HYDRO data layers, part of the larger Statewide Florida Composite ESI database, for additional ESI information. Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) is more properly known as \"Sensitivity of Coastal Habitats and Wildlife to Spilled Oil\" Atlases. The term \"ESI\" is often used in reference to the whole dataset, but the term \"ESI\" is really a reference to the classification system of shoreline types known as Environmental Sensitivity Index, that classifies a shoreline on a scale from 1 to 10 based upon overall sensitivity to spilled oil. FWRI contracted out updates to Florida's ESI data for the Panhandle and South Florida in the years 2010 through early 2013. However, FWRI wanted and needed a statewide product for use within the Marine Resources Geographic Information System (MRGIS) and the Florida Marine Spill Analysis System (FMSAS).

The Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. §§ 1301 et seq.) grants coastal states title to natural resources located within their coastal submerged lands and navigable waters out to three geographical miles from their coastlines (three marine leagues for Texas and Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coastlines). The Submerged Lands Act defines “natural resources” to include oil, gas, and all other minerals, and fish, shrimp, oysters, clams, crabs, lobsters, sponges, kelp, and other marine animal and plant life,” yet expressly excludes “water power, or the use of water for the production of power” 43 U.S.C. § 1301(e). The term “coast line” is “the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters” (43 U.S.C. § 1301(c)). Some boundary delineations are approximated, including areas in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington State. The official delineation of the Submerged Lands Act in these locations has not yet been established by BOEM. Please reference BOEM’s official Submerged Lands Act Boundary in these locations to determine where this boundary is approximated and where it is official. - Source: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title43/pdf/USCODE-2011-title43-chap29.pdf - Date Enacted: May 22, 1953 - Codification: 43 U.S.C.
